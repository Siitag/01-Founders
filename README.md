# 01-Founders
Work from the coding school 01Founders which I attended.

# Piscine
The piscines were 3 week long hackathons/bootcamps where we learned a new language and worked on projects. The languages I learned were golang and javascript. This process was used to learn how to program in a new language and to learn how to work individually and helping other to benefit ourselves.

# Projects
The projects such as forum and groupie tracker were used to teach us how to program in groups.
